Whatever is decided at the&nbsp;negotiation tables, we need to show our resolve to continue to demand&nbsp;climate justice and a massive transition to renewable energy.&nbsp;Please join 350NYC, 350BK and 350NJ and allied faith, labor and student&nbsp;groups in \"Protect What You Love/Climate Justice Now\" at the Statue of Liberty on Saturday&nbsp;December 12, 2015 9:15 am-1:00 pm.&nbsp;Our presence at the Statue of Liberty will send a message to world leaders that we stand together to&nbsp;protect all we hold dear from the threat of catastrophic climate change. As the embodiment of our&nbsp;freedom and liberty, a gift from France as an expression of solidarity with our democratic values, a&nbsp;safe harbor for refugees, and a symbol of hope for people seeking a better life, the Statue of Liberty&nbsp;provides an ideal backdrop for our urgent message.&nbsp;</p><p>Note: We will come dressed wearing green to signify our unified call for climate justice and a swift&nbsp;transition to renewable energy.
