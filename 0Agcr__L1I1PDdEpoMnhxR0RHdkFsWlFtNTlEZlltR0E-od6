Utah.  A back of the envelope climate organizing powermap includes at least 8 main groups that have different tactics but all revolve around the goal of 350ppm by the end of the century.  Also with the new math that 80% of the proven fossil fuel reserves is 5 times above the allowable limit to stay within a 2degree Celcius ties our campaigns share the movment goal to make sure that product does not go to market.  Divestment campaigns are developing at 4 UT college campuses, anti-tarsands coalitions are forming strong relationships and learing from the blockades in TX, high school youth are pushing state agencies and legislators to collaborate and develop long range plans to reflect best available science of climate change, the Utah Citizens Climate Lobby is pushing our Republican congressional representatives to adopt a carbon fee and dividend bill and Transition town Salt Lake city is experimenting with models of resliliency.\n\nWhat advice do you have for ubased old the climate movement in Utah?  What skills can you lend to the various campaigns above?\n\nA brief history of the last 3 years of the climate movement here:  Many people that organized the first 350SLC group in 2009 formed Peaceful Uprising and since then others have begun to fill at least 4 different niches under at least 8 different names.  \n\n, longitude: -111.89109, latitude: 40.7606467",

Utah.  A back of the envelope climate organizing powermap includes at least 8 main groups that have different tactics but all revolve around the goal of 350ppm by the end of the century.  Also with the new math that 80% of the proven fossil fuel reserves is 5 times above the allowable limit to stay within a 2degree Celcius ties our campaigns share the movment goal to make sure that product does not go to market.  Divestment campaigns are developing at 4 UT college campuses, anti-tarsands coalitions are forming strong relationships and learing from the blockades in TX, high school youth are pushing state agencies and legislators to collaborate and develop long range plans to reflect best available science of climate change, the Utah Citizens Climate Lobby is pushing our Republican congressional representatives to adopt a carbon fee and dividend bill and Transition town Salt Lake city is experimenting with models of resliliency.\n\nWhat advice do you have for ubased old the climate movement in Utah?  What skills can you lend to the various campaigns above?\n\nA brief history of the last 3 years of the climate movement here:  Many people that organized the first 350SLC group in 2009 formed Peaceful Uprising and since then others have begun to fill at least 4 different niches under at least 8 different names.  \n\n"

We also are supporting a Divest UO campaign!
