We are part of a network of  thousands of volunteer-run campaigns in over 188 countries.\n\n350 means climate safety. To preserve our planet, scientists tell us we must reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere from its current levels of nearly 400 parts per million to below 350 ppm. But 350 is more than a number\u2014it\u2019s a symbol of where we need to head as a planet. We believe that if a global grassroots movement holds our leaders accountable to realities of science and principles of justice, we can realize the solutions that will ensure a better future for all."
