In 2010, we organised the Global Work Party when we promoted renewable sources of energy at local level. In 2011, we worked on capacity building and educational activities in secondary schools, we took part in 'Moving Planet Day' at National University, an event that mobilized over 700 participants. The group helped in preparing the Trans-African caravan of hope on climate change, a journey that departed from Bujumbura to Durban, SA for COP 17.Once we get registered, we plan to strengthen partnerships with local actors to be able to implement our projects focused on collecting a data base on the climate status at national level, producing a local documentary film on impacts of climate change and promote larger use of renewable energy. \n\nFor more: http://campagne350burundi.wordpress.com/, latitude: -3.376217, longitude: 29.359349",

          "$t": "350 Burundi started in 2009 when we organised the first global day of action on climate change. Individuals, youth and environmental groups became very excited about the action of 350 and joined. In 2010, we organised the Global Work Party when we promoted renewable sources of energy at local level. In 2011, we worked on capacity building and educational activities in secondary schools, we took part in 'Moving Planet Day' at National University, an event that mobilized over 700 participants. The group helped in preparing the Trans-African caravan of hope on climate change, a journey that departed from Bujumbura to Durban, SA for COP 17.Once we get registered, we plan to strengthen partnerships with local actors to be able to implement our projects focused on collecting a data base on the climate status at national level, producing a local documentary film on impacts of climate change and promote larger use of renewable energy. \n\nFor more: http://campagne350burundi.wordpress.com/"
