Last May we organized a well-publicized Connect the Dots event that resulted in a meeting with our local utility, Tucson Electric Power (TEP).  Working with the Tucson Climate Action Network (TUCAN), we are engaged in a series of escalating actions to bring public awareness to Tucson's dependence on dirty coal. As part of TUCAN, we meet monthly, at least, on the second Wednesday of the month at 7 pm at the Quaker Meetinghouse at 931 N 5th Ave.  When there is a 350 specific event, we either have breakout meetings at that meeting, or use it to schedule other meeting times that may vary. We intend to continue until the climate is fixed! "

It's only fitting: Portland is known for its epic sustainability, from its broad mass transit to its urban growth boundary.\n\nIf you are interested in joining or getting involved contact with 350 Portland, email 350pdx@gmail.com or Vossandreae@gmail.com (Adriana Voss-Andreae)."
